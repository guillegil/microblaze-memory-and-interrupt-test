# Microblaze Interrupt and DDR Memory configuration

The files in this project have been written for Genesys 2 board. Nevertheless the project is easy to recreate.

In order to run the project:

1. If the OS is Windows execute `build.bat`, if linux open Vivado and source `project.tcl`.
2. Wait until the write_bitstream is complete.
3. Open Vitis, create a new Application project selecting the system_hw.xsa generated by Vivado and Create a project with *helloword* template.

4. Replace `helloworld.c` by `main.c` located at `/src` folder.
5. Build and run the application.

This application configure the UART and GPIO interrupts:
- The UART interrupt receives a single character and load the binary data into the leds.
- The SW and BUTTONS interrupts just print the interrupt source through the uart.
